First, let's read the SpaceX dataset into a Pandas dataframe and print its summary

from js import fetch
import io

URL = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/dataset_part_2.csv"
resp = await fetch(URL)
dataset_part_2_csv = io.BytesIO((await resp.arrayBuffer()).to_py())
df=pd.read_csv(dataset_part_2_csv)
df.head(5)


First, let's try to see how the FlightNumber (indicating the continuous launch attempts.) and Payload variables would affect the launch outcome.

We can plot out the FlightNumber vs. PayloadMassand overlay the outcome of the launch. We see that as the flight number increases, the first stage is more likely to land successfully. The payload mass is also important; 
it seems the more massive the payload, the less likely the first stage will return.

sns.catplot(y="PayloadMass", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Flight Number",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Pay load Mass (kg)",fontsize=20)
plt.show()


We see that different launch sites have different success rates. CCAFS LC-40, has a success rate of 60 %, 
while KSC LC-39A and VAFB SLC 4E has a success rate of 77%.

Next, let's drill down to each site visualize its detailed launch records.

### TASK 1: Visualize the relationship between Flight Number and Launch Site
# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Flight Number and y axis to be the launch site, and hue to be the class value

sns.catplot(y="LaunchSite", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("Flight Number",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("LaunchSite",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

### TASK 2: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Launch Site

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Pay Load Mass (kg) and y axis to be the launch site, and hue to be the class value

sns.catplot(y="LaunchSite", x="PayloadMass", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("PayloadMass",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("LaunchSite",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

### TASK  4: Visualize the relationship between FlightNumber and Orbit type

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be FlightNumber and y axis to be the Orbit, and hue to be the class value

sns.catplot(y="Orbit", x="FlightNumber", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("FlightNumber",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

### TASK  5: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Orbit type
# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Payload and y axis to be the Orbit, and hue to be the class value

sns.catplot(y="Orbit", x="PayloadMass", hue="Class", data=df, aspect = 5)
plt.xlabel("PayloadMass",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

### TASK  6: Visualize the launch success yearly trend

# A function to Extract years from the date 
year=[]
def Extract_year():
    for i in df["Date"]:
        year.append(i.split("-")[0])
    return year
Extract_year()
df['Date'] = year
df.head()
    
# Plot a line chart with x axis to be the extracted year and y axis to be the success rate

df.groupby(['Date']).mean()['Class'].plot(kind='line')
plt.xlabel("Year",fontsize=20)
plt.ylabel("Success Rate",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

### TASK  7: Create dummy variables to categorical columns

features_one_hot= pd.get_dummies(features,columns=['Orbit','LaunchSite','LandingPad','Serial','GridFins','Reused','Legs'])
features_one_hot

### TASK  8: Cast all numeric columns to `float64`
features_one_hot.astype(float)
### TASK  3: Visualize the relationship between success rate of each orbit type
